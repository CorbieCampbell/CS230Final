# Software Design Document for The Gaming Room and their application: Draw It Or Lose It


## _Q: Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?_ ##

### A: The Gaming Room came to Creative Techonology Solutions and requested our assistance on their Android exclusive application, a game called "Draw It or Lose It", to make it servicable to multiple platforms like Windows, MacOS & iOS, and Linux. They needed assistance to streamline the development of their Java based Android app to other operating systems; in doing so we assisted them by both implementing a functional API and giving a proper analysis on other operating systems. Specifically giving a detailed report on the platforms & architectures, and analyzing the storage & memory managemnt as well as distributed systems and security recommendations. ###

## _Q: What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?_ ##

### A: Gaining the information and giving an effective report on the different operating systems for software development was personally one of the most enjoyable parts of this project. I gained a deeper understanding on the multiple different platforms that developers can design platforms on. It was extremely effective in understanding the requirements and grand scope of how platforms like the security tight MacOS or the extremly customizable Linux operate. It was the overall conrnerstone of what The Gaming Room sought to do, being able to understand and know the requirements on hosting and connecting to multiple operating systems for both application functionality and user growth. ###

## _Q: What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?_ ##

### A: The design document was extremely helpful in getting a baseline and further understanding on the proper requirements needed to effectively help The Gaming Room, and completing their mission. It worked like a blueprint, the document helped in fully outlining and get a broader scope on the problem. Which in turn greatly helped in brainstorming ideas and concepts to properly develop and implement strategies to efficiently apply resolutions. ###

## _Q: If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?_ ##

### A: While the REST API & Basic Authorization developed within the program does give a good basis for platform connectivity and both user and server security, it has it's downsides. The REST API itself is very reliant on the internet and the architecture is very strict (doesn't allow for a lot of flexbility). Other API's might be more suitable for both administrative flexbility and can bolster overall connection for all users. And while Basic-Auth is a good system for security protection, it does not provide great encryption since the usernames and passwords can be very susceptible to interception over the internet. New, alternative, and adding additional security measures could make the application more safe to use for both users and can help reduce the attack area for the overall server. ###

## _Q: How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?_ ##

### A: Research on user experience on multi-platform games that were similar to The Gaming Room's application was greatly helpful in understanding the user's needs. Knowing the key features like reliable connectivity, seamless & familiarity on user interface, and maintaining user security are big needs when a user decides to utilize software that both connects them to the internet and to multiple other users from both similar and other operating platforms. The users needs being met helps ensure the success of the product. High user satisfaction and engagement not only meets the goals of the company, but also ensures that ethical coding standards are met to ensure safe and reliable software is being produced. ###

## _Q: How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?_ ##

### A: Use of a UML diagram first and foremost was an effective technique to ensure the overall software design met industry standards, as well as helping keep the development orderly and clean. The use of a singleton was an important feature to meet the "teams" and multiple users requirement laid out by The Gaming Room. Implementing the Basic Authorization & REST API gave the application the utility to become multi-platform functional and give it the security to keep both its owners & users safe. These tools can be great starting points for future applications, as they can be built upon and further advanced to meet similar future requirements in other software. ###
